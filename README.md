# Po Valley Resilience Analysis

A multi-sensor **Crop Monitoring Framework** that provides a high-resolution, physically explainable view of the rice cultivation cycle in the Po Valley. By integrating three distinct Sentinel constellations, this project translates satellite documentation into a fully operational technical solution.

## Features
- **Sentinel-1 (Radar):** Direct Anonymous Cloud Processing of EOPF Zarr data for VV Backscatter tracking.
- **Sentinel-2 (Optical):** AWS Earth Search COG streams for NDVI canopy density tracking.
- **Sentinel-3 (Thermal):** Sentinel Hub API bridge for mapping Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and thermal stress.
